# Adaboost-Implementation
In this repository, I have implemented adaboost algorithm from scratch
This implementation is a part of my University course - Introduction to statistical machine learning

For the implementation, I have used decision stumps as the weak learner.

I have used Wisconsin Diagnostic Breast Cancer dataset to test your model. All the data 
points are stored in the file “wdbc_data.csv”
